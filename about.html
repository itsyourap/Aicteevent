                "Pioneering the Future of Healthcare: Robotics, Deep Learning, and Emerging Tech," the ATAL FDP,
                aims to equip participants with cutting-edge expertise in technologies that are reshaping the healthcare domain. This program explores different advancements such as robotics, deep learning, and self-supervised learning, highlighting their transformative potential for patient care, diagnostics, and various therapies. The FDP helps people from different fields work together on healthcare projects that include research. This prepares them to build future-focused healthcare systems that are more accurate, efficient, and patient-oriented. This FDP program will drive participants to contribute to innovative, technology-driven improvements in healthcare delivery and management.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Importance of the FDP</h2>
            <p class="mb-6 text-blue-900 font-bold text-lg">
                The field of higher education is currently undergoing a transformative phase in order to adapt to
                global trends. The National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020 serves as a guiding light for this transformative journey. The community of quality teachers holds great potential in driving these changes and plays a crucial role in the development, sharing, and dissemination of knowledge. In the present scenario, with disruptive technological advancements, the role of higher education teachers has become more important than ever before. NEP 2020 aims to empower these teachers by providing them with capacity-building training and workshops, enabling them to identify, define, and implement the necessary changes. Without the active involvement of a competent body of quality higher education teachers, the vision of achieving the status of a global knowledge leader, known as Vishwa Guru, cannot be realized.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Expected Outcomes</h2>
            <p class="text-blue-900 font-bold text-lg">
                This FDP aims to foster a comprehensive grasp of emerging healthcare technologies like robotics,
                AI, and deep learning, alongside practical skills for addressing real-world healthcare challenges. Participants will gain hands-on experience with advanced solutions, such as predictive models and robotic applications for diagnostics and therapy. The FDP program promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, supporting research in cutting-edge healthcare sectors. Educators will be empowered to incorporate these technologies into curricula, enriching student learning and equipping them for future demands. Additionally, participants are expected to enhance their research outputs, potentially leading to publications and inventions while advancing professionally as leaders in tech-driven healthcare innovation.
